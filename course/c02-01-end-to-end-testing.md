## Introduction to E2E testing

> **ref**: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test

To perform an E2E testing, we need to do the following procedure:

1. Open the cypress executable
2. Configure E2E Testing
3. Create a new empty spec
4. Add the test file

once you run your cypress executable with the `npx cypress open`
or `yarn run cypress open` command, you should see the following screen.

Once the cypress executable is open, you can simply press the `E2E Testing`
button to initialize your e2e test in your current workspace. This will add
the following files to your workspace:

```
ðŸ“‚ my-project
â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“ƒ cypress.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚ cypress
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚ fixtures
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ðŸ“ƒ example.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ðŸ“‚ support
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“ƒ commands.js
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ðŸ“ƒ e2e.js
...
```

After  E2E testing is configured, we can select our preferred browser to start
E2E testing.

Once the browser is selected, we can then create a new empty spec to start
writing our first test. This will create a new file `cypress\e2e\spec.cy.js`
which we can edit to add our test specifications.

## Writing the first E2E test

As creating an empty spec creates `cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js` file which contains
a sample test case, which is shown below:

```js
describe('empty spec', () => {
  it('passes', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')
  })
})
```

The code block above will visit https://example.cypress.io and the test will be
passed since there is nothing to assert.

If we try to assert something that should fail, then it will fail the test. For
example, if we add a line as shown below, then the test case will fail.

```diff
describe('empty spec', () => {
  it('passes', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')
++  expect(true).to.equal(false)
  })
})
```

Similarly, if we write something that should pass, then it should again pass
all the tests. To test this, we replace the line
`expect(true).to.equal(false)` with `expect(true).to.equal(true)` as shown
below:

```diff
describe('empty spec', () => {
  it('passes', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')
--  expect(true).to.equal(false)
++  expect(true).to.equal(true)
  })
})
```

here, the value `true` is asserted to `true` which means the expected value and
obtained values both are true hence the test passes.
