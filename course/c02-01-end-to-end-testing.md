## Introduction to E2E testing

> **ref**: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test

To perform an E2E testing, we need to do the following procedure:

1. Open the cypress executable
2. Configure E2E Testing
3. Create a new empty spec
4. Add the test file

once you run your cypress executable with the `npx cypress open`
or `yarn run cypress open` command, you should see the following screen.

Once the cypress executable is open, you can simply press the `E2E Testing`
button to initialize your e2e test in your current workspace. This will add
the following files to your workspace:

```
ðŸ“‚ my-project
â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“ƒ cypress.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚ cypress
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚ fixtures
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ðŸ“ƒ example.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ðŸ“‚ support
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“ƒ commands.js
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ðŸ“ƒ e2e.js
...
```

After  E2E testing is configured, we can select our preferred browser to start
E2E testing.

Once the browser is selected, we can then create a new empty spec to start
writing our first test. This will create a new file `cypress\e2e\spec.cy.js`
which we can edit to add our test specifications.
